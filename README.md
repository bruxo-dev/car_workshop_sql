# Car Workshop Schema Documentation

## Project Overview

This project involves the design and implementation of a database schema to manage operations in a mechanical workshop. The database includes entities such as clients, vehicles, mechanics, teams, service orders, services, and parts. It was designed with performance, scalability, and clarity in mind, ensuring easy understanding and maintainability for developers.

## Objectives

1. **Understand the Project Requirements**:
   Create a relational database schema based on the provided feature goals:
   - Control and management system for executing work orders in a mechanical workshop.
   - Customers take vehicles to the mechanic workshop to be repaired or to undergo periodic inspections.
   - Each vehicle is assigned to a team of mechanics who identify the services to be performed and fill out an OS with a delivery date.
   - From the OS, the value of each service is calculated, consulting a labor reference table.
   - The value of each piece will also be part of the OS, the client authorizes the execution of the services.
   - The same team evaluates and performs the services.
   - Mechanics have a code, name, address and specialty.
   - Each OS has: number, date of issue, a value, status and a date for completing the work.  

2. **Convert the Schema to DBML**:
   - Using the finalized SQL schema, translate the structure into DBML (Database Markup Language).
   - Include detailed comments for each table, column, and relationship to provide context for other developers.

3. **Generate a Visual Representation**:
   - Import the DBML file into [dbdiagram.io](https://dbdiagram.io/) to create a graphical representation of the database schema.
   - Use the visual diagram for a better understanding of the relationships and hierarchy among entities.

## Steps Followed

### 1. **Receiving the Feature Goals**
   - The project's goals were provided in narrative form. The requirements highlighted the need for tables representing workshop operations, such as clients, vehicles, teams, service orders, and their associated details.
   - Assumptions were made to fill any gaps in the narrative, ensuring a logical and functional schema. These assumptions were documented in the comments.

### 2. **Schema Design and Validation**
   - The schema was designed using SQL, with a focus on:
     - **Normalization**: To reduce redundancy and ensure data integrity.
     - **Performance**: By implementing indexing, constraints, and optimized data types.
     - **Clarity**: By using consistent naming conventions and detailed comments.

### 3. **DBML Conversion**
   - The SQL schema was created with DBML format:
     - Translating SQL syntax into DBML constructs.
     - Preserving all comments and relationships for clarity.
     - Testing the DBML file for syntax check and compatibility with dbdiagram.io.

### 4. **Visual Representation**
   - The DBML file was uploaded to [dbdiagram.io](https://dbdiagram.io/), which generated a clear and interactive diagram of the database schema.
   - This diagram provides a quick and intuitive way to understand the schema's structure and relationships.

## How to Use

2. **Generate the Diagram**:
   - Copy the DBML content into [dbdiagram.io](https://dbdiagram.io/) code editor.
   - Adjust the new generated schema positioning structure and test the database relations.

3. **Database Deployment**:
   - Use the SQL schema for creating the database in any MySQL-compatible system.
   - Modify the schema as needed to fit the specific environment or additional requirements.

## Notes

- The schema ensures scalability and maintainability, suitable for expanding workshop operations.
- Detailed comments make it easier for developers to understand the database's purpose and structure.
- If any changes are required, ensure updates are reflected in the DBML file for consistency.
